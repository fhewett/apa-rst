# APA-RST
Corpus of 75 parallel texts, simplified on two levels, annotated with RST. The RST annotations can be found in the `rst/` folder, separated according to the complexity level. The aligned files can be found in the `alignments/` folder and the original texts in the `original_texts` folder.

## Notes on the aligned files

The `alignments/` folder contains three subfolders:
- in `or-b1` the sentences from the original texts are on the line that corresponds to the line in the B1 text
- `or-a2` same but for the A2 texts
- `b1-a2` the sentences from the B1 texts are on the line that corresponds to the line in the A2 text

If there are multiple sentences on one line, that means that multiple sentences were aligned to one sentence. If the line is empty, this means that no alignment was found.
